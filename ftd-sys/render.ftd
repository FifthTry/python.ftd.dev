`ftd_sys.render()` renders a single ftd file and returns the generated HTML.

-- ft.code:
lang: py

def render(id: str, data: str) -> str

-- ft.h1: `id`

`ftd_sys.render()` accepts the "id" of the document to be built. The ID
corresponds to the relative path of the URL after the base_url has been removed.

Eg if the current fpm package's name is `amitu.com/foo/` and the specific
document we are looking for is `amitu.com/foo/bar/`, the `id` would be `/bar/`.

-- ft.h1: `data`

The document being rendered may use [`get-data`
processor](https://fpm.dev/processors/get-data/), the passed `data` is made
available to `get-data`.

The `data` is JSON serialised string version of the data.
